Here's the complete game design document for your Office Chaos game:

# Office Chaos: A Time Management Game

## Game Overview
"Office Chaos" is a fast-paced, single-player time management game set in a modern tech startup office. Players take on the role of a software engineer managing various office tasks while racing against time.

## Core Gameplay Loop
- Complete tasks within time limits
- Manage multiple computers and printers
- Attend Zoom meetings
- Fix technical issues
- Balance priorities between meetings and tasks

## Game Mechanics

### Task Management
- Task queue displayed on screen UI
- Visual timers above interactive objects
- Tasks appear in queue with priority levels
- Meetings have higher priority than regular tasks

### Character Controls
- Basic movement around the office
- Can carry only one item at a time
- Must stand in designated spots to interact with objects
- Can multitask during meetings if staying within meeting "view zone"

### Computer Interactions
1. **States**
   - Normal (working)
   - Blue Screen of Death (broken)
   - In Meeting (Zoom)
   - File Transfer Mode

2. **Fixing Computers**
   - Requires USB repair tool
   - Timer-based repair process
   - Visual indicator shows repair progress

### Zoom Meetings
- Requires full duration attendance
- "View zone" mechanic allows limited multitasking
- Gibberish talk sound effects during meetings
- Visual timer shows meeting progress
- Missing meetings heavily impacts failure meter

### Printer Mechanics
- Paper jams indicated by red exclamation mark
- Requires player to stop and fix
- Toner replacement tasks
- Simple timer-based interaction

### USB File Transfers
- Carry USB between computers
- Timer-based transfer process
- Must complete transfer before moving USB

## Level Design

### Level 1: Basic Introduction
- 2-3 computers
- Basic tasks: File transfers, printing
- No broken computers
- Simple meeting schedule

### Level 2: Technical Issues

- Three strikes system for missed meetings

## Visual Style
- 2D cartoon art style
- Clear visual indicators for:
  - Task status
  - Computer states
  - Meeting zones
  - Interaction areas
  - Warning states

## Audio Design
- Meeting gibberish sounds
- Computer error sounds
- Printer sounds
- Task completion jingles
- Warning sound effects

## UI Elements
1. **Main HUD**
   - Task queue
   - Current score
   - Failure meter
   - Time remaining

2. **Computer Status**
   - Timer displays
   - State indicators

## Stretch Goals
1. **Multiplayer Mode**
   - Co-operative play
   - Split responsibilities
   - Shared task queue

2. **Additional Office Layouts**
   - Different floor plans
   - New navigation challenges
   - Varied computer arrangements

3. **Custom Difficulty Modes**
   - Speed adjustments
   - Task frequency modifications
   - Custom failure conditions

Would you like me to:
1. Elaborate on any specific aspect of the design?
2. Start working on technical specifications for Godot implementation?
3. Create mockups or descriptions of the UI layout?
4. Detail the scoring system further?
